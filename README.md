### macOS

Mak<sup>mini</sup> is the menubar version of [Mak](https://mak.ink). But unlike the browser version, Mak<sup>mini</sup> is **NOT** designed to be focused on for long writings. The goal of it is **easy to access**.

That said, many features in Mak (like read/split preview mode) are disabled in Mak<sup>mini</sup>.

You can use it just like other stickers app, to-do lists, quick notes, a temporary clipboard with read-it-later URLs. You can put inside **anything you don't know where to put**.
